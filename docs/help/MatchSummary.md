The Match Summary dialog displays a summary view of the search results. The
number of matches and number of files with matches is displayed at the top of
the window. The list box has one line for each matching file and displays:

     File Name      the name of the file   
     File Time      the file last modified date and time

     Data      the total number of matches in the file that occur in the data sections   
     Code      the total number of matches in the file that occur in the code sections   
     Comment      the total number of matches in the file that occur only in comments

A left mouse click on the column headers will cause the list to be resorted by
that column. The first sort will be ascending, click again to sort in
descending order.
