Introduction</p><hr>
<p class="Normal">
With Kwik Source Search (KSS) you can perform powerful standard and regular expression searches through
one or multiple text files, such as source code, logging, and debugging information.</p>
<p class="Normal">
KSS is capable of finding the exact text you are looking for in any ASCII file or files. However, sometimes
you have only part of the information that you want to match, or you want to find a wider range of information.
In such cases, KSS has the powerful capability to search for patterns of text using <a href="html\UsingRegularExpressions.htm">regular
expressions</a>.</p>
<p class="Normal">
The underlying search engine for KSS is the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490907.aspx">Findstr</a>
command.  KSS provides a convenient, user friendly, interface for the many command line options.  Search
text is always treated as a literal search string [/l and /c:] and files with non-printable characters
are always skipped [/p].  The regular expression functionality of the Findstr command is used for the
main text search.  There are many examples that can be found on the internet.</p>
<p class="Normal">
KSS captures and filters the output of the Findstr command, opens the file associated with the selected
result list item, and displays it in a syntax highlighting editor built on the <a href="http://www.scintilla.org">Scintilla</a>
control.  KSS has built-in styling for the Clarion language and can easily be extended, through the use
of special <a href="html\PropertyFiles.htm">property files</a>, to provide styling for other languages supported
by the Scintilla control.</p>
